# 🌌 3D Solar System using Three.js

Hey there! 👋  
This is a 3D Solar System simulation I built using **Three.js**. It’s fully interactive and lets you explore the planets revolving around the sun in real-time. You can even control the revolution speed of each planet using sliders!

## 🚀 What I’ve built

- A realistic solar system with the Sun and 8 planets 🌞🪐
- All planets rotate on their axis and revolve around the Sun
- Smooth animations using JavaScript + Three.js
- A space-themed skybox for an immersive feel
- Orbit controls for zooming, rotating, and panning
- Speed sliders to control how fast each planet moves

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- HTML + JavaScript
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- OrbitControls
- Texture mapping
- Skybox rendering
